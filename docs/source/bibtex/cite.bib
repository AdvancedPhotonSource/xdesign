In an attempt to make material models, data acquisition schemes and reconstruction algorithms more accessible to researchers lacking expertise in some of these areas, a software package is described here which can generate complex simulated phantoms and quantitatively evaluate new or existing data acquisition schemes and image reconstruction algorithms for targeted applications.},keywords = {tomography, data acquisition, simulation, phantom, scanning X-ray probe, reconstruction, quality, open-source, Python, experiment design},}
