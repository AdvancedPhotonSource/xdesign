abstract = {A method of reconstruction (ART) has recently been proposed (Gordon, Bender {\&} Herman, 1970) which consists in iteratively changing a trial structure until its projections are consistent with the original projections of the unknown structure. It is shown that in general ART produces erroneous reconstructions. An alternative iterative method is proposed which will give correct reconstructions under certain conditions. One of the potential applications of this method is in determining the three-dimensional structure of objects from electron micrographs. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

Here a software package developed in MATLAB for script command generation and analysis of TXM data is presented. The first toolkit, the script generator, allows automating complex experimental tasks which involve up to several thousand motor movements. The second package was designed to accomplish computationally intense tasks such as data processing of mosaic and mosaic tomography datasets; dual-energy contrast imaging, where data are recorded above and below a specific X-ray absorption edge; and TXM X-ray absorption near-edge structure imaging datasets. Furthermore, analytical and iterative tomography reconstruction algorithms were implemented. The compiled software package is freely available.},

Thus, here an architecture based on a high-level control system that manages low-level data acquisition, data processing and device changes is described.

  abstract={A novel approach to image reconstruction for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been developed. It is based on a constrained optimization technique for the reconstruction of difference resistivity images without finite-element modelling. It solves the inverse problem by optimizing a cost function under constraints, in the form of normalized boundary potentials. Its application to the neighbouring data collection method is presented here. Mathematical models are developed according to specified criteria. These express the reconstructed image in terms of one-dimensional Lagrange multiplier functions. The reconstruction problem becomes one of estimating these functions from normalized boundary potentials. This model is based on a cost criterion of the minimization of the variance between the reconstructed and the true resistivity distributions. The algorithm was tested on data collected in a cylindrical saline-filled tank. A polyacrylamide rod was placed in various positions with or without a peripheral plaster of Paris ring in place. This was intended to resemble the conditions during EIT of epileptic seizures recorded with scalp or cortical electrodes in the human head. One advantage of this approach is that compensation for non-uniform initial conditions may be made, as this is a significant problem in imaging cerebral activity through the skull.}

abstract = "To reduce scanning time and/or improve spatial/temporal resolution in some Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) applications, parallel \{MRI\} acquisition techniques with multiple coils acquisition have emerged since the early 1990s as powerful imaging methods that allow a faster acquisition process. In these techniques, the full \{FOV\} image has to be reconstructed from the resulting acquired undersampled k-space data. To this end, several reconstruction techniques have been proposed such as the widely-used \{SENSitivity\} Encoding (SENSE) method. However, the reconstructed image generally presents artifacts when perturbations occur in both the measured data and the estimated coil sensitivity profiles. In this paper, we aim at achieving accurate image reconstruction under degraded experimental conditions (low magnetic field and high reduction factor), in which neither the \{SENSE\} method nor the Tikhonov regularization in the image domain give convincing results. To this end, we present a novel method for SENSE-based reconstruction which proceeds with regularization in the complex wavelet domain by promoting sparsity. The proposed approach relies on a fast algorithm that enables the minimization of regularized non-differentiable criteria including more general penalties than a classical ℓ1 term. To further enhance the reconstructed image quality, local convex constraints are added to the regularization process. In vivo human brain experiments carried out on Gradient-Echo (GRE) anatomical and Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) functional \{MRI\} data at 1.5 T indicate that our algorithm provides reconstructed images with reduced artifacts for high reduction factors.

  abstract={Monte Carlo simulation is an essential tool in emission tomography that can assist in the design of new medical imaging devices, the optimization of acquisition protocols and the development or assessment of image reconstruction algorithms and correction techniques. GATE, the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission, encapsulates the Geant4 libraries to achieve a modular, versatile, scripted simulation toolkit adapted to the field of nuclear medicine. In particular, GATE allows the description of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement, and source decay kinetics. This feature makes it possible to simulate time curves under realistic acquisition conditions and to test dynamic reconstruction algorithms. This paper gives a detailed description of the design and development of GATE by the OpenGATE collaboration, whose continuing objective is to improve, document and validate GATE by simulating commercially available imaging systems for PET and SPECT. Large effort is also invested in the ability and the flexibility to model novel detection systems or systems still under design. A public release of GATE licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License can be downloaded at http://www-lphe.epfl.ch/GATE/ [http://www-lphe.epfl.ch/GATE/] . Two benchmarks developed for PET and SPECT to test the installation of GATE and to serve as a tutorial for the users are presented. Extensive validation of the GATE simulation platform has been started, comparing simulations and measurements on commercially available acquisition systems. References to those results are listed. The future prospects towards the gridification of GATE and its extension to other domains such as dosimetry are also discussed.}

abstract = {Sub-second temporal-resolution tomographic microscopy is becoming a reality at third-generation synchrotron sources. Efficient data handling and post-processing is, however, difficult when the data rates are close to 10GBs${\sp {$-$}1}$. This bottleneck still hinders exploitation of the full potential inherent in the ultrafast acquisition speed. In this paper the fast reconstruction algorithm {\it gridrec}, highly optimized for conventional CPU technology, is presented. It is shown that {\it gridrec} is a valuable alternative to standard filtered back-projection routines, despite being based on the Fourier transform method. In fact, the regridding procedure used for resampling the Fourier space from polar to Cartesian coordinates couples excellent performance with negligible accuracy degradation. The stronger dependence of the observed signal-to-noise ratio for {\it gridrec} reconstructions on the number of angular views makes the presented algorithm even superior to filtered back-projection when the tomographic problem is well sampled. {\it Gridrec} not only guarantees high-quality results but it provides up to 20-fold performance increase, making real-time monitoring of the sub-second acquisition process a reality.},

abstract = {A new, freely available third party MATLAB toolbox for the simulation and reconstruction of photoacoustic wave fields is described. The toolbox, named k-Wave, is designed to make realistic photoacoustic modeling simple and fast. The forward simulations are based on a k-space pseudo-spectral time domain solution to coupled first-order acoustic equations for homogeneous or heterogeneous media in one, two, and three dimensions. The simulation functions can additionally be used as a flexible time reversal image reconstruction algorithm for an arbitrarily shaped measurement surface. A one-step image reconstruction algorithm for a planar detector geometry based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is also included. The architecture and use of the toolbox are described, and several novel modeling examples are given. First, the use of data interpolation is shown to considerably improve time reversal reconstructions when the measurement surface has only a sparse array of detector points. Second, by comparison with one-step, FFT-based reconstruction, time reversal is shown to be sufficiently general that it can also be used for finite-sized planar measurement surfaces. Last, the optimization of computational speed is demonstrated through parallel execution using a graphics processing unit.},

abstract = "Based on the transport-of-intensity equation and the Fourier transform, a rapid phase retrieval algorithm for X-ray phase contrast imaging is described in detail. This algorithm is a non-iterative phase retrieval method, and it has a potential speed for large scale X-ray phase contrast images. Then the numerical simulation is made to evaluate the rapid phase retrieval algorithm performance. Finally, a real fiber material experiment is carried out using a micro focus X-ray phase contrast imaging experiment platform, and the phase distribution image is calculated out by this algorithm. The result shows that this phase retrieval algorithm is effective and optional to practical application. "

abstract = "Phase contrast, a noninvasive microscopy imaging technique, is widely used to capture time-lapse images to monitor the behavior of transparent cells without staining or altering them. Due to the optical principle, phase contrast microscopy images contain artifacts such as the halo and shade-off that hinder image segmentation, a critical step in automated microscopy image analysis. Rather than treating phase contrast microscopy images as general natural images and applying generic image processing techniques on them, we propose to study the optical properties of the phase contrast microscope to model its image formation process. The phase contrast imaging system can be approximated by a linear imaging model. Based on this model and input image properties, we formulate a regularized quadratic cost function to restore artifact-free phase contrast images that directly correspond to the specimen’s optical path length. With artifacts removed, high quality segmentation can be achieved by simply thresholding the restored images. The imaging model and restoration method are quantitatively evaluated on microscopy image sequences with thousands of cells captured over several days. We also demonstrate that accurate restoration lays the foundation for high performance in cell detection and tracking. "
