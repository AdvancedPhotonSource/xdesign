**XDesign** is an open-source Python package for generating
configurable simulation phantoms for benchmarking tomographic
image reconstruction.

Current Scope
=====
* Customizable 2D phantoms constructed from circles and convex polygons
* Quantitative reconstruction quality and probe coverage metrics
* Attenuation interactions with X-ray probes of uniform flux
* Use of analytic (exact) solutions for algorithms and computation
